# Numerical Algorithms

Welcome to the "Numerical Algorithms" repository, which serves as the primary source material for KAIST course "MAS365: Introduction to Numerical Analysis". Here, you'll find a rich collection of resources including homework assignments, lecture slides, MATLAB codes, and exam materials that extensively cover various numerical approximation algorithms and demonstrate their stability.

## üìö Repository Structure

- **Homeworks**: This folder contains the homework assignments given throughout the course. They are designed to test your understanding of the lectures and your ability to apply the numerical algorithms learned in practical scenarios.

- **Lecture Slides**: Here you will find the slides used in the lectures. These slides are a comprehensive resource, presenting the theoretical foundation of the numerical algorithms discussed in the course.

- **Matlab Codes**: This folder is a goldmine for anyone looking to understand the practical implementation of numerical algorithms using MATLAB. It contains script files that illustrate how to implement various numerical algorithms such as Power Method, Fixed-Point Iteration, and Newton-Cotes Integration.

- **Past Exams**: A collection of previous exams to help you prepare for the midterm and final exams. They come with solutions to facilitate self-study and to understand the kind of questions that can be expected in the exams.

- **.DS_Store**: This is a system file used by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.

- **README.md**: The file you're currently reading. It provides an overview of the repository and explains the purpose and content of each file and folder.

- **final.pdf** and **midterm.pdf**: These PDF files contain the question papers for the final and midterm exams during Spring 21, providing a clear expectation of the exam pattern and the type of questions that are generally asked.

- **final_sol.pdf** and **midterm_sol.pdf**: Solution manuals for the final and midterm exams, offering detailed solutions to each question, serving as an excellent resource for understanding and revision.

- **Stability_Test.m**: A MATLAB script file developed to demonstrate the stability of various numerical algorithms through a series of tests.
